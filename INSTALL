JIC is written in Python 2.7 and uses jira-python library.

To install all the dependencies do the following as root:

1. install setuptools

    e.g. for debian testing that can be done as:

        $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-setuptools libpython2.7-dev python2.7-dev

    If your Linux does not have such a package available, see
    http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html


2. install pip

    e.g. for debian testing that can be done as:

        $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

    If your Linux does not have such a package available, see
    http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html


3. install oauth2 (needed for OAuth)

    $ sudo apt-get install python-oauth2

    OR

    $ sudo pip install oauth2


4. install requests-oauthlib (needed for OAuth)

    $ sudo pip install requsts-oauthlib


5. install jira.python

    $ sudo pip install jira-python


6. install pycrypto (needed for OAuth)

    $ sudo pip install pycrypto


    NOTE: if you get the following error message during the
    installation, make sure your TMP env var is pointing to the location
    which can be used to execute binaries from:

    """
        checking whether we are cross compiling... configure: error: in
            `/tmp/pip-build-root/pycrypto':

        configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.

    """

    To do that use something like:

        # mkdir ./tmp
        # TMP=./tmp pip install pycrypto
        # rm -Irf ./tmp


7. optional - install python-magic

    If you're getting the following error

        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "./jic", line 1532, in <module>
            main()

            exit(cmd(cfg, args[2:]))

            jira = get_jira(cfg)

            self._magic = magic.Magic(mime=True)
        TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mime'

    try installing python-magic (using pip, not apt-get):

    $ sudo pip install python-magic


8. Put config file into ~/.jic/

9. Create symlinks for the porcelain mode commands

    $ jic commands symlink


On the first attempt to run jic it will try to import the existing
config at ~/.jicrr. Please use the example config provided to create
your own.
